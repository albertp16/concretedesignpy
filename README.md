ConcreteDesignPy is a Python library for designing and analyzing reinforced concrete structures, supporting NSCP 2015 and ACI 318-19. The library provides structural engineers with efficient design tools for flexure, shear, axial loads, and moment interaction.

---

## 📥 **Installation**

ConcreteDesignPy can be installed via **PyPI** once it is publicly available:

```bash
pip install concretedesignpy
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest development version directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/concretedesignpy.git
```

## 🛠️ **Features**
✔ **Flexural & Shear Design** (NSCP 2015 & ACI 318-19)  
✔ **Column Capacity & Interaction Diagrams**  
✔ **CFRP Reinforcement Considerations**  
✔ **Manders' Concrete Model** for confinement effects  
✔ **Moment Interaction Analysis** for axial & bending  
✔ **Error Handling & Design Warnings**

## 🔍 **Features in Details**

### 1️⃣ **Manders' Concrete Model**  
Implements **Manders' Model** to account for the confinement effect in concrete, improving structural efficiency and accuracy in column and beam analysis.

### 2️⃣ **Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Support**  
Supports **CFRP reinforcement modeling**, considering bond characteristics, failure modes, and strain limitations.

### 3️⃣ **Moment-Interaction Analysis**  
Generates **moment-axial interaction diagrams** for reinforced concrete columns, incorporating biaxial bending effects and cross-section variability.

<!-- ## 🚀 **Usage Example**

Here's a quick example to compute the moment capacity of a reinforced concrete beam:

```python
from concretedesignpy import Beam

beam = Beam(b=300, d=600, f'c=28, fy=420, As=1200)  
moment_capacity = beam.calculate_moment_capacity()
print(f"Moment Capacity: {moment_capacity} kN·m")
```

For **column interaction diagrams**:

```python
from concretedesignpy import Column

column = Column(b=400, h=400, f'c=35, fy=420, As=2000)  
interaction_curve = column.generate_interaction_diagram()
interaction_curve.plot()
```
