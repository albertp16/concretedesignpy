Joint Shear Verification
=========================

Verifies joint shear for special moment frames per
**NSCP 2015 Section 418.8.4** (equivalent to ACI 318M-14 Section 18.8.4).

Governing edition
-----------------
This module targets **NSCP 2015**, the governing Philippine code, whose
joint-shear provisions follow **ACI 318M-14**. It is NOT ACI 318-19/-25:
that edition replaced the three-row gamma table used here with the
eight-row Table 18.8.4.3. See NSCP_2015_TABLE_418_8_4_1 below.

Not checked here
----------------
Joint transverse reinforcement, development of beam bars into the joint,
and the column-to-beam flexural strength ratio.

# confined by framing members.

    Joint shear verification for special moment frames.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ve : float
        Column shear (kN).
    as1 : float
        Area of one bar in group 1 (mm^2).
    n_bars1 : int
        Number of bars in group 1.
    as2 : float
        Area of one bar in group 2 (mm^2).
    n_bars2 : int
        Number of bars in group 2.
    fy : float
        Steel yield strength (MPa).
    fc : float
        Concrete compressive strength (MPa).
    beam_width : float
        Width of the beam, b (mm).
    joint_depth : float
        Overall depth of the column, h, in the direction of the joint
        shear considered (mm).
    column_width : float
        Overall width of the column perpendicular to the joint shear
        considered (mm). Keyword-only and required: without it the
        governing cap on Aj cannot be applied.
    perpendicular_dist : float
        Perpendicular distance from the column side face to the nearest
        beam edge, x (mm). Zero when the beam is flush with, or wider
        than, the column.

        NOTE for the next reader: this is measured **beam face to column
        face**, and that is deliberate. Section 15.5.2.2(b) is worded
        "twice the perpendicular distance from longitudinal axis of beam
        to nearest side face of the column", i.e. 2 * (b/2 + x), which is
        identically b + 2x. Fig. R15.5.2.2 draws the same limit as
        "b + 2x" with x face-measured. Do not "fix" this back to 2 * x.
    joint_config : int
        Row of NSCP 2015 Table 418.8.4.1 (a three-row table):
        1 = confined on all 4 faces (gamma 1.7),
        2 = confined on 3 or 2 opposite faces (gamma 1.2),
        3 = other (gamma 1.0).
        An unrecognised value raises rather than silently scoring 1.0.
    lamda : float
        Lightweight concrete factor. Must be 0.75 (lightweight) or
        1.0 (normalweight) -- these are the only two legal values.
    phi : float
        Strength reduction factor for shear. Fixed at 0.85 for
        special-moment-frame joints; passing anything else raises.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Keys: t1, t2, v_joint, joint_width, aj, vn, phi_vn, status

    Notes
    -----
    This function checks joint shear only. It does not check joint
    transverse reinforcement, bar development into the joint, or the
    column-to-beam flexural strength ratio.
